Overview
--------

* A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack with the purpose of preventing legitimate users from using a specified network resource such as a website, web service, or computer system. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a coordinated attack on the availability of services of a given target system or network that is launched indirectly through many compromised computing systems. The services under attack are those of the primary victim, while the compromised systems used to launch the attack are often called the secondary victims/bots. 

* Two types of DDoS attack networks have emerged: the Agent-Handler model and the Internet Relay Chat (IRC)-based model.
	- The Agent-Handler model of a DDoS attack consists of clients, handlers, and agents. The client is where the attacker communicates with the
rest of the DDoS attack system. The handlers are software packages located throughout the Internet that the attacker’s client uses to communicate with the agents. The agent software exists in compromised systems that will eventually carry out the attack. The attacker communicates with any number of handlers to identify which agents are up and running, when to schedule attacks, or when to upgrade agents. 

	- The IRC-based DDoS attack architecture is similar to the Agent-Handler model except that instead of using a handler program installed on a network server, an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) communication channel is used to connect the client to the agents.

* I used the Agent-Handler model, where 
	- Client software used to communicate with the bots/agents - ssh, botMaker.c
	- Agent Searching is done using - botSearcher.py
	- Handler installed in compromised system - ssh
	- Agent software performing attack - TCPSyn.py, TCPpsh+ack.py, udpflood.py

* There are two main classes of DDoS attacks : bandwidth depletion and resource depletion attacks. 
	* A bandwidth depletion attack is designed to flood the victim network with unwanted traffic that prevents legitimate traffic from reaching the primary victim. 
		- In this project I will be demonstrating a UDP Flood Attack:
			+ In a UDP Flood attack, a large number of UDP packets are sent to either random or specified ports on the victim system. The victim system tries to process the incoming data to determine which applications have requested data. If the victim system is not running any applications on the targeted port, it will send out an ICMP packet to the sending system indicating a "destination port unreachable" message

	* A resource depletion attack is an attack that is designed to tie up the resources of a victim system making the victim unable to process legitimate requests for service.
		- Protocol Exploit Attacks: Given two examples, one misusing the TCP SYN (Transfer Control Protocol Synchronize) protocol, and the other misusing the PUSH+ACK protocol.
			+ In a DDoS TCP SYN attack, the attacker instructs the bots to send bogus TCP SYN requests to a victim server in order to tie up the server’s processor resources, and hence prevent the server from responding to legitimate requests. The TCP SYN attack exploits the three-way handshake between the sending system and the receiving system by sending large volumes of TCP SYN packets to the victim system with spoofed source IP addresses, so the victim system responds to a non-requesting system with the ACK+SYN. When a large volume of SYN requests are being processed by a server and none of the ACK+SYN responses are returned, the server eventually runs out of processor and memory resources, and is unable to respond to legitimate users.
			+ In a PUSH + ACK attack, the attacking agents send TCP packets with the PUSH and ACK bits set to one. These triggers in the TCP packet header instruct the victim system to unload all data in the TCP buffer (regardless of whether or not the buffer is full) and send an acknowledgement when complete. If this process is repeated with multiple agents, the receiving system cannot process the large volume of incoming packets and the victim system will crash.

* Because of time constraints, I have skipped the process of getting the password of the compromised systems, hence i assumed that i have the username and password of the bots in the network and I have also assumed that all/most of the systems have same username and password.

		Victim:
		++++++

Implemented Case studies
------------------------
	Resource Depletion attacks:
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++        
		1. TCP SYN flooding attack:
		===========================	
			$sudo python botSearcher.py
			----------------------------
				* This code will look for IP addresses in the local network using nmap tool. To change the network address, edit line 4 of this program.
				* This tool will save the results in "nmapOP.xml" file. 
				* "botSearcher.py" will then parse this xml file and looks for systems which are up and whose ports are unfiltered and store the IP address of those systems in "IPList.txt" file.
		
			$gcc -pthread botMaker.c
			-------------------------
		
			$./a.out
			--------		
				* "botMaker.c" will take the username and password of the bots and will also take the input as name of the python code for implementing this attack. In this case filename is "TCPSyn.py". This attack will be for 60 seconds. This time value can be changed by changing the value on line 104 in TCPSyn.py file.
				* To change the victim's IP address edit line 36 of "TCPSyn.py". 
				* To spoof the source IP address edit line 35 of "TCPSyn.py" 
		
			Output:
			-------
				* On terminal, login screen of connected hosts will appear. Error messages from unsuccessful connection to hosts will also appear. After the attack, "success" message will be displayed from the all the hosts.
				* Can also run wireshark on the victim system to see the packets.
				* Can use any browser to load the webpage hosted on victim's system, if attack is successful, the page will take more time to load.	  
				* Can ping to the victim and see the time difference after the attack

Take away from the project
--------------------------
	DoS/DDoS attacks are the weapon of choice for cyber-hacktivist groups and are increasing in severity and complexity. This project, for demonstrating DDOS has helped us understand various attacks that takes place in real life. I have also learned that once a single system is compromised, one can easily launch an attack on the network. 


Future Enhancements
-------------------
	1) Add more attacks:
		* Smurf attack
		* TCP URG attack
		* Attack in application layer/non-network based attack
	2) Configuring web-server to make/prevent attack
